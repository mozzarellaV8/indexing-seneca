# from the desk of Seneca

#### letter 59 (9-10)

...I shall ask you something I often turn over in my thoughts; **_why does stupidity have so firm a hold over us?_** 

1. Because we do not fend it off vigorously nor strive for recovery with our full strength; 

2. Because we do not trust the discoveries of wise men enough nor take them in with open hearts, only take a light stand on such a great matter.

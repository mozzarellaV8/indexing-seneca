## Book I

#### Letter 1 (Book I.1)
_In answer to Lucilius, who has declared himself determined to make the best use of his time._

#### Letter 2 (Book I.2) 
_On restlessness, whether in physical travel or indiscriminate reading._

#### Letter  3 (Book I.3)
_On the proper basis of real friendship. Seneca warns Lucilius against making a man into a friend before he knows the man's character. But once someone has become a friend, he should be trusted and should share one's anxieties._

#### Letter 4 (Book I.4)
_On cultivating tranquility of mind and rejecting fear of death. Seneca starts from the comparison of a man becoming wise to a boy coming of age. It is equally foolish to scorn life and to fear death, and calmness can be achieved by learning that there is no reason to fear death, which is always with us._

#### Letter 5 ( Book I.5)
_On avoiding conspicuous austerity and the meaning of 'living according to Nature.' Adopting a severe lifestyle is one aspect of the wider issue of shunning the crowd, and actually withdrawing or retiring from public life raised in letters 7 and 8._

#### Letter 6 (Book I.6)
_Seneca offers Lucilius evidence of his own gradual advance in virtue._

#### Letter 7 (Book I.7)
_On the gratuitous cruelty of public executions in the arena and the moral harm done by contact with the crowd of spectators and their vicious relish for human suffering. But any contact with vicious men will only corrupt (•6). One has to avoid either imitating common attitudes or hating them, and teach only those ready to learn, not trying to convert a general audience. Even a single listener, or none at all, is good enough for the man behaving rightly. It is important to distinguish the enforced combats of batches of condemned criminals sent to fight until one of their opponents should kill them, from the skilled combat of trained gladiators in appropriate defensive armour. See M. Wistrand,_ Entertainment and Violence in Rome in the First Century AD _(Oxford: Oxford UP, 1978)._

#### Letter 8 (Book I.8)
_On withdrawal_ (secedere): _Seneca continues the theme of withdrawal from letter 7, but adds that his withdrawal is a positive retirement in order to write for the future enlightenment of posterity. Lucilius should shun the tastes and indulgences of the crowd. Instead Seneca turns to recommendations (based on his own example) for a life spent in withdrawal even from accepted social obligations._

#### Letter 9 (Book I.9)
_On self-sufficiency and the value of friendship. Seneca returns to the theme of friendship from a new point of view; the wise man should not need friends. But he does need them to be objects of his kindness, and Seneca distinguishes between self-interested and altruistic friendship._

#### Letter 10 (Book I.10)
_On the potential harm from bad company and the need to address only honest prayers to God even away from other men._

#### Letter 11 (Book I.11)
_On physical blushing and moral bashfulness. Seneca argues that there are physical reactions a man cannot control and should not be blamed for. In •8 he uses his ''Epicurean'_ envoi _to change to a different theme; the recommendation to imagine one's actions under the observation of a respected and virtuous man._

#### Letter 12 (Book I.12)
_Seneca uses a visit to his childhood home to illustrate how the  decay in his country villa, the decline of plane trees he himself planted, and finally the ageing of his childhood playmate have convinced him of his advanced age. This leads to consideration (•6) of each day as a fraction of a larger unit of natural time and the span of life, and the proper way to look forward to death, not unlike the maudlin Pacuvius (•8) who staged a performance of his own funeral every evening._
